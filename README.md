# Metroid for the NES clone
This repo was a WIP reproduction of the game Metroid for the NES. This was meant to learn a bit about the usage of the framework LibGDX for cross-platform game-making.
Currently, only the first room and the first enemies (Zoomers, the little spiky monsters) of the game have been implemented.
All assets used (music, sprites, tiles) belong to Nintendo.
